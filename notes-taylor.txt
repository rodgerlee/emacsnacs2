added search page
    input text and click icon to search recipe by keyword
    SearchScreen - deals with search bar and api request
    RecipeLoader - loading screen while user types / on call
    RecipeBody* - displays recipe
        (*incomplete)
    SearchResult* - displays recipe cards from search result
        (*currently broken)

goal:
    SearchScreen displays recipe cards from search results
    when a RecipeCard is clicked, api request for recipe is made,
        and the recipe (RecipeBody) can be viewed

    advanced search options
    search with pantry items -> need to see how pantry gets implemented

bug:
    could not figure out how to implement SearchResults with FlatList
    now too tired to focus; will back up and sleep
